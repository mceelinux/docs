# Waydroid Tweaks
#### Running apps in separate windows
If you prefer running Minecraft Education in a window instead of the Waydroid shell, you can run the following command from your terminal while Waydroid is running:
```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.multi_windows true
```

#### Disabling on-screen keyboard
If you dislike the on-screen keyboard popping up, follow the steps outlined below:
1. Open Settings in the Waydroid Shell
2. Find the `System` category and click it
3. Find `Languages & input` and click it
4. Click `Physical keyboard`
5. Disable the `Use on-screen keyboard` setting
